        <p>Basic Consultancy - 1 hour consultation where we provide a brief sketch and outline of plants for a small garden (patio, courtyard, etc.)</p>
        <p>Planting Plan - 1 hour consultancy where we provide a planting plan - detailing plants that can be used in an existing garden (front and back gardens). This consultancy does not change the layout or construction of the garden but enhances the existing garden structure.</p>
