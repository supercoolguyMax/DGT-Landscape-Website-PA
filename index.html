		<h2> Design and Consultation </h2>
		<p> We offer a wide range of flexibility in design and consultancy.
Basic Consultancy - 1 hour consultation where we provide a brief sketch and outline of plants for a small garden (patio, courtyard, etc.)
Planting Plan - 1 hour consultancy where we provide a planting plan - detailing plants that can be used in an existing garden (front and back gardens). This consultancy does not change the layout or construction of the garden but enhances the existing garden structure.
Front OR Rear Section Consultancy - 1 hour consultancy for either the front or rear section where we provide a sketch of the area and outline plants for the designated area. 
Other Consultancy - We offer an hourly charge for consultancy service which can include / exclude any of the above consultancy packages. </p>
